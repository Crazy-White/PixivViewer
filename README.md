## PixivViewer
 An experimental PixivViewer based on [AD's API](https://api.imjad.cn/)  
 This project is written in PHP.  
 And it's a simple project for my php study.  
 There is a preview site <https://moe.readyspace.io>  
## Explanation
 include "debug.php" to debug  
 "view.php" is a proxy for pixiv's images and it may work throught Chinese network  
 now it supports "following" "painter(member_illust)" "painting(illust)" "related"
